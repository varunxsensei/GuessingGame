<h1>🇺🇳 Flag Guessing Game</h1><br/><br/>
A simple and fun iOS app built with SwiftUI where users guess the correct flag out of three options. This mini-project is part of my journey into iOS development — a great hands-on exercise to explore SwiftUI basics, state management, and layout design.

<h2>🛠 Features</h2><br/><br/>
🎯 Random flag selection from a list of 11 countries

🧠 Score tracking

📲 Interactive UI with flag buttons and alerts

🌈 Beautiful gradient background

🎉 Dynamic reshuffling after each question
